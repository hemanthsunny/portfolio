  "text": "There are many rooms in the world. It's our choice to pick a room at what stage of our life. To open and explore a room, the only thing that we can do is - <br> Vision and Action. Vision is the key to see the future. And action is the path to reach the end. <br> I've vision but lazy in action. <br> I can perform action but I don't know where am I going. <br> Both are dangerous concepts. If you have vision, then don't give up till you reach the end. Otherwise with your key, others will reach the destination (I experienced). If you have action, then vision it. So don't be late to pick and explore your favorite room."
